\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{DO}} create one pull request per Issue, and ensure that the Issue is linked in the pull request. You can follow the \mbox{\hyperlink{md_PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE}{Pull Request Template}} for this.
\item {\bfseries{DO}} follow our \href{\#style-guidelines}{\texttt{ Coding and Style}} guidelines, and keep code changes as small as possible.
\item {\bfseries{DO}} include corresponding tests whenever possible.

\item {\bfseries{DO}} link the issue you are addressing in the pull request.
\item {\bfseries{DO}} write a good description for your pull request. More detail is better. Describe {\itshape why} the change is being made and {\itshape why} you have chosen a particular solution. Describe any manual testing you performed to validate your change.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{DO NOTs}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{DO NOT}} merge multiple changes into one PR unless they have the same root cause.
\item {\bfseries{DO NOT}} merge directly into the master branch.

Submitting a pull request for an approved Issue is not a guarantee it will be approved. The change must meet our high bar for code quality, architecture and performance. \end{quote}

\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Preparing your development environment}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md7}

The code in this project uses several different coding styles, depending on the age and history of the code. Please attempt to match the style of surrounding code as much as possible. In new components, prefer the patterns described in the \href{https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines}{\texttt{ C++ core guidelines}}.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{Code formatting}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md9}
{\itshape {\bfseries{Run clang-\/format}}}

Use the following commands from the project\textquotesingle{}s root directory to run clang-\/format (must be installed on the host system).

{\bfseries{1. Run the CMake target for {\ttfamily clang-\/format}\+:}}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build build -\/-\/target clang-\/format}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries{2. Using clang-\/format\+:}}

\DoxyCodeLine{clang-\/format -\/i *.h}

Your change should include tests to verify new functionality wherever possible. Code should be structured so that it can be unit tested independently of the UI. Manual test cases should be used where automated testing is not feasible.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{Git workflow}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md11}
The core principle of the project, when it comes to Git workflows is that the {\ttfamily master} branch should always be in a healthy state which is ready for release. Every commit on master should be deployable on push. To ensure this, pull request {\bfseries{must not}} be made directly on master. {\bfseries{Each change}} should either be made in the {\bfseries{development branch}} (named a variation of development, i.\+e. {\ttfamily dev}) or in a separate branch, named as a short summary of the change.

If your change is complex, please clean up the branch history before submitting a pull request. You can use \href{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing}{\texttt{ git rebase}} to group your changes into a small number of commits which we can review one at a time.

When completing a pull request, we will generally squash your changes into a single commit. After confirming that the change works as intended, the branch {\itshape might} be deleted, in order to prevent branch polluting. Please let us know if your pull request needs to be merged as separate commits.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{Continuous Integration}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md12}
For this project, CI is provided by \href{https://github.com/features/actions}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub Actions}}, with workflows found in the \href{.github/workflows}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily .github/workflows} folder}}. Workflows are run automatically on every commit made on the master branch, unless told to skip for that particular commit.

To skip CI runs on a particular commit, include either {\ttfamily \mbox{[}skip ci\mbox{]}} or {\ttfamily \mbox{[}ci skip\mbox{]}} in the commit message.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# an example of a commit message that would not trigger CI workflows}
\DoxyCodeLine{git commit -\/m "{}my normal commit message [skip ci]"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# or}
\DoxyCodeLine{git commit -\/m "{}my normal commit message [ci skip]"{}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{Review process}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md13}
After submitting a pull request, members of the team will review your code. We will assign the request to an appropriate reviewer (if applicable). Any member of the community may participate in the review, but at least one member of the project team will ultimately approve the request.

Often, multiple iterations or discussions will be needed to responding to feedback from reviewers. Try looking at \href{https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template/pulls?q=is\%3Apr+is\%3Aclosed}{\texttt{ past pull requests}} to see what the experience might be like.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysection{Contributor License Agreement}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md14}
Before we can review and accept a pull request from you, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The CLA ensures that the community is free to use your contributions. Signing the CLA is a manual process, and you need to do it for each pull request made. This is done by checking the boxes in the \href{PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md\#Pull-Request-Readiness-Checklist}{\texttt{ Pull Request Readiness Checklist of a Pull Request}}.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsection{IMPORTANT}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md15}
{\itshape {\bfseries{Checking the aforementioned boxes means that you agree to provide your change and/or code FREE TO USE and SUBJECT TO CHANGES for the entire community!}}}

You don\textquotesingle{}t need to sign a CLA until you\textquotesingle{}re ready to create a pull request. When your pull request is created, it is reviewed by a team member which, if the change is trivial (i.\+e. you just fixed a typo) will be labelled as {\ttfamily cla-\/not-\/required}. Otherwise, it\textquotesingle{}s classified as {\ttfamily cla-\/required}, if not already signed.
