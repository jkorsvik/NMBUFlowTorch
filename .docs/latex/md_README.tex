A simple C++ implementation of Neural Nets, inspired by the functionality of Tensorflow and py\+Torch.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysubsection{Features}\label{md_README_autotoc_md24}

\begin{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Modern {\bfseries{CMake}} configuration and project, which, to the best of my knowledge, uses the best practices,
\item An example of a {\bfseries{Clang-\/\+Format}} config, inspired from the base {\itshape Google} model, with minor tweaks. This is aimed only as a starting point, as coding style is a subjective matter, everyone is free to either delete it (for the {\itshape LLVM} default) or supply their own alternative,
\item {\bfseries{Static analyzers}} integration, with {\itshape Clang-\/\+Tidy} and {\itshape Cppcheck}, the former being the default option,
\item {\bfseries{Doxygen}} support, through the {\ttfamily ENABLE\+\_\+\+DOXYGEN} option, which you can enable if you wish to use it,
\item {\bfseries{Unit testing}} support, through {\itshape Google\+Test} (with an option to enable {\itshape Google\+Mock}) or {\itshape Catch2},
\item {\bfseries{Code coverage}}, enabled by using the {\ttfamily ENABLE\+\_\+\+CODE\+\_\+\+COVERAGE} option, through {\itshape Codecov} CI integration,
\item {\bfseries{Package manager support}}, with {\itshape Conan} and {\itshape Vcpkg}, through their respective options
\item {\bfseries{CI workflows for Windows, Linux and Mac\+OS}} using {\itshape Git\+Hub Actions}, making use of the caching features, to ensure minimum run time,
\item $\ast$$\ast$.md templates$\ast$$\ast$ for\+: {\itshape README}, {\itshape Contributing Guideliness}, {\itshape Issues} and {\itshape Pull Requests},
\item {\bfseries{Permissive license}} to allow you to integrate it as easily as possible. The template is licensed under the \href{https://unlicense.org/}{\texttt{ Unlicense}},
\item Options to build as a header-\/only library or executable, not just a static or shared library.
\item {\bfseries{Ccache}} integration, for speeding up rebuild times

This project is meant as a template and a good starting point for learning how create larger c++ projects, compile and run them. can be change to better suit the needs of the developer(s). If you wish to use the template {\itshape as-\/is}, meaning using the versions recommended here, then you will need\+:

\item {\bfseries{C++ Compiler}} -\/ needs to support at least the {\bfseries{C++17}} standard, i.\+e. {\itshape MSVC}, {\itshape GCC}, {\itshape Clang}

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysubsubsection{Installing}\label{md_README_autotoc_md29}
It is fairly easy to install the project, all you need to do is clone if from {\bfseries{Git\+Hub}}.

If you wish to clone the repository, you simply need to run\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/jkorsvik/NMBUFlowTorch/}

\end{DoxyCode}
 or 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone git@github.com:jkorsvik/NMBUFlowTorch.git}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\itshape {\bfseries{Install requirements (cmake, conan, etc..)}}}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{source install\_reqs.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\itshape {\bfseries{Build and install project as an executable}}} 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{source automatic\_rebuild\_and\_install.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape {\bfseries{If you just want to rebuild fast and you are happy with the install location, run\+:}}} 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{source cached\_build\_and\_install.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}
 The executables of the project will then be in the

To install an already built project, you need to run the {\ttfamily install} target with CMake. For example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build build -\/-\/target install -\/-\/config Release}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# a more general syntax for that command is:}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build <build\_directory> -\/-\/target install -\/-\/config <desired\_config>}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you have not built the project yet, the {\ttfamily automatic\+\_\+rebuild\+\_\+and\+\_\+install.\+sh} will do fine, otherwise follow the next section\+:

$>${\bfseries{Note}}\+: {\itshape If you want to supress a lot of warnings when building, see the \href{CMakeLists.txt}{\texttt{ CMake\+Lists.\+txt}} at line 145 and 146, and uncomment the preferred.}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysubsection{Building the project}\label{md_README_autotoc_md30}
To build the project, all you need to do, {\itshape {\bfseries{after correctly \href{README.md\#Installing}{\texttt{ installing the project}}}}}, is run a similar {\bfseries{CMake}} routine to the the one below\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build/ \&\& cd build/}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake .. -\/DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=/absolute/path/to/custom/install/directory}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build . -\/-\/target install}

\end{DoxyCode}


\begin{quote}
{\itshape {\bfseries{Note\+:}}} $\ast$\+The custom {\ttfamily CMAKE\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+\_\+\+PREFIX} can be omitted if you wish to \end{quote}
install in \href{https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GNUInstallDirs.html}{\texttt{ the default install location}}.$\ast$

More options that you can set for the project can be found in the \href{cmake/StandardSettings.cmake}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily cmake/\+Standard\+Settings.\+cmake} file}}. For certain options additional configuration may be needed in their respective {\ttfamily $\ast$.cmake} files (i.\+e. Conan needs the {\ttfamily CONAN\+\_\+\+REQUIRES} and might need the {\ttfamily CONAN\+\_\+\+OPTIONS} to be setup for it work correctly; the two are set in the \href{cmake/Conan.cmake}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily cmake/\+Conan.\+cmake} file}}).\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysubsection{Generating the documentation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md31}
In order to generate documentation for the project, you need to configure the build to use Doxygen. This is easily done, by modifying the workflow shown above as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build/ \&\& cd build/}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake .. -\/D<project\_name>\_ENABLE\_DOXYGEN=1 -\/DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=/absolute/path/to/custom/install/directory}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build . -\/-\/target doxygen-\/docs}

\end{DoxyCode}


\begin{quote}
{\itshape {\bfseries{Note\+:}}} {\itshape This will generate a {\ttfamily docs/} directory in the {\bfseries{project\textquotesingle{}s root directory}}.} \end{quote}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md32}{}\doxysubsection{Running the tests}\label{md_README_autotoc_md32}
By default, the template uses \href{https://github.com/google/googletest/}{\texttt{ Google Test}} for unit testing. Unit testing can be disabled in the options, by setting the {\ttfamily ENABLE\+\_\+\+UNIT\+\_\+\+TESTING} (from \href{cmake/StandardSettings.cmake}{\texttt{ cmake/\+Standard\+Settings.\+cmake}}) to be false. To run the tests, simply use CTest, from the build directory, passing the desire configuration for which to run tests for. An example of this procedure is\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build          \# if not in the build directory already}
\DoxyCodeLine{ctest -\/C Release  \# or `ctest -\/C Debug` or any other configuration you wish to test}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# you can also run tests with the `-\/VV` flag for a more verbose output (i.e.}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#GoogleTest output as well)}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md33}{}\doxysubsubsection{End to end tests}\label{md_README_autotoc_md33}
If applicable, should be presented here.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md34}{}\doxysubsubsection{Coding style tests}\label{md_README_autotoc_md34}
If applicable, should be presented here.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md35}{}\doxysubsection{Contributing}\label{md_README_autotoc_md35}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md36}{}\doxysubsubsection{Devolopment}\label{md_README_autotoc_md36}
After finishing getting a copy of the project, with any of the methods above, create a new folder in the {\ttfamily include/} folder, with the name of your project. Edit {\ttfamily cmake/\+Sources\+And\+Headers.\+cmake} to add your files.

You will also need to rename the {\ttfamily cmake/\+Project\+Config.\+cmake.\+in} file to start with the {\itshape {\bfseries{exact name of your project}}}. Such as {\ttfamily cmake/\+My\+New\+Project\+Config.\+cmake.\+in}. You should also make the same changes in the Git\+Hub workflows provided, notably \href{.github/workflows/ubuntu.yml}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily .github/workflows/ubuntu.\+yml}}}, in which you should replace the CMake option {\ttfamily -\/DProject\+\_\+\+ENABLE\+\_\+\+CODE\+\_\+\+COVERAGE=1} to {\ttfamily -\/DMy\+New\+Project\+\_\+\+ENABLE\+\_\+\+CODE\+\_\+\+COVERAGE=1}.

Finally, change {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Project\char`\"{}} from {\ttfamily CMake\+Lists.\+txt}, from
